# A/B Result – One‑pager (Executive)

**Summary (one paragraph):**  
E.g., “Moving the first gate from 30→40 changed Day‑7 retention by X pp (p=Y). Guardrails (D1, gamerounds): OK/Not OK. Decision: Ship/Don’t ship.”

**Headline numbers:**  
- D7: Control = __ %, Variant = __ %, Lift = __ pp, p = __  
- D1 (guardrail): Control = __ %, Variant = __ %, p = __  
- Gamerounds (guardrail): median/mean difference and quick comment

**Risk & Notes:**  
- Any segment where Variant underperforms? (light/medium/heavy)  
- Any data quality issues?

**Decision:** Ship / Don’t ship / Inconclusive  

**Next Step:** One concrete follow-up test idea.
